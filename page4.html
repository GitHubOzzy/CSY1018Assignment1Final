            <h3>MDN Web Docs</h3>
            <p>By far the most useful resource I found when constructing my webpage was
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a>. This was an extremely helpful website that contains everything about CSS and HTML that is needed to create a website. 
            It includes examples that you can tinker with to alter them to your needs. All the information is also kept as up to date as possible so all the information is valid. 
            Mozilla has provided a valid and helpful resource that is from a trusted source.</p>

        <div class="pageFourContent2">
            <h3>Liz Coulter-Smith and Nile</h3>
            <p>Another very helpful resource theat i used extensivley throughtout my work were the resources on nile given to us
            by <a href="https://www.northampton.ac.uk/directories/people/liz-coulter-smith/">Liz Coulter-Smith. </a>Liz Coulter-Smith is a tutor at the University of Northampton and teaches Website Development. 
            She was available for consultation and discussion to help on this project. All her information was very helpful and also trusted as a source. Nile also lists all the information/sources with interactive examples and is structured corresponding to the weeks we learnt them
            for easy navigation.</p>

        <div class="pageFourContent3">
            <h3>Codepen.io</h3>
            <p>Another very helpful website was<a href="https://codepen.io/"> Codepen.io. </a> This is a website that lets you upload small snippets of code to an online compiler that then lets you edit and alter the code to see the effects in realtime.
            This is helpful because it gives you access to a wide range of solutions to problems you may have encountered. It is also helpful to change elements in realtime to see the desired effects.
            When doing the initial design of my website in our group, Codepen was also useful to see different design and layouts that gave inspiration.</p>

        <div class="pageFourContent4">
            <h3>CSS Tricks</h3>
            <p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">CSS Tricks</a> is a website that has small guides to problems you will encounter when creating a website for example,
            a guide to flexbox layout and positioning as well as media query guides. This website was very helpful when i first started off with the positioning of images in flexbox but also the media query examples it showcases. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pageFourContent5">
            <h3>Placeholder</h3>
            <p><a href="https://placeholder.com/">Placeholder</a> is a website that generates placeholder images for your website of any dimesion. I have used one on the <a href="index.html">Index page</a> of this website.
            it is very useful for mockups/wireframes of websites to show where images will go, it also dispalys the dimension of the image in the placeholder image itself. </p>
