                <h2>Wireframes and inspiration</h2>
                <p>For the creation of my website (even before i started coding) I had decided to have a clean simple layout with only a few key colours. This would drive attention towards
                    the content on the page and allow it to be seen easily. This can be evidenced in the wireframe picture to the right. </p>

                    <p>When i did start coding, i followed the deisgn of the website <a href = "https://www.dotdash.com/">DotDash.</a> This website uses coloured blocks to seperate its content with a video in the middle,
                    you can see how i have tried to emulate it on the <a href = "index.html"> Homepage.</a> I also tried to have my webpage show some feedback to the user when they are navigating it. For example the navigation bar has a nice hover effect with a fade-in, 
                    and also the current page you are on his emboldened so it easy to see especially on smaller devices.</p>

                <h2>Group Work Discussions</h2>
                <p>When working with others in a group, i saw that using background colours made the website look old and not engaging. I saw that other people were using big background images instead of colours and
                    drew inspiration from them. From this i decided to use a screenshot of my own code for the background.
                </p>
                <p>Working in a group was also extremely useful with helping to find the right combination of colours to use as i was biased towards my own website. An example of this was the colour for the font.
                    This took quite a while to implement because of the background image colour being a dark grey. I thought plain white text was too plain and so after discussing it with group, we decided on a pale blue colour which is being used now.</p>

                    <p>Group work also helped with the media queries, things that seemed obvious to me did not to others. When these issues were pointed out to me i was able to make changes to make things visually clearer. An example of this was the background image. 
                        On smaller devices, the background image text was the same size as the website font, so i changed it so that the background image dissapears on devices smaller than 1024px. This cleared up the issue some people had.</p>
                <h2>Testing</h2>
                <p>To test my website i validated all the code on W3C Validator (Both HTML and CSS) and all pages passed with no errors and minimal warnings</p>
