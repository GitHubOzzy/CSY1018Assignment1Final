                        <h2>How was the module going so far?</h2>

                    <p>Before this module i had not touched HTML/CSS in about 4 years. 
                        Because of this, the beginning weeks were fairly comfortable for me as they served more as a reminder of what i had already learnt rather than a brand new experience. 
                        Things quickly picked up around week 4 as we started looking into flexbox positioning. 
                        This was all new to me as i had used a piece of software called Dreamweaver to create my website (not recommended). 
                        It took me too week 7 before i even started to code my website,
                        because of other commitments i have and all the time consumption that comes with the first term at University but when i finally did get around to it...
                        <h2>It was a nightmare.</h2> 
                        <p>Trying to remember all the things that had come and gone in the weeks before, spending many late nights rewatching all the videos Liz had put up on Nile
                        and the stress of having to absorb the new subjects before i had even had a go at the previous weeks subjects. As i started to get a hang of the layout and syntax of HTML/CSS, things started to click in place. 
                        Day by day i was fixing problems that had me stumped for hours on end the previous night and eventually i started to enjoy the progress i was making
                        with my website (Even after restarting my website 2 times and lets not talk about media queries). You can see the previous attempts at my website and the wireframe on the <a href = "page5.html"> MGP Page.</a> 
                        It has been a big learning experience and helped me get better not only at web development but planning and starting projects in general. 
                        In Conclusion, This first term of Web development has been an enjoyable if not slightly stressful experience! I still have much to learn but i am confident i will get there... eventually.

                    <h2>Warnings and Errors</h2>
                    <p>I am happy to announce there are no errors on any of my pages, and only minimal warnings which are listed below:-</p>
                        <p>Property -webkit-transition is an unknown vendor extension - This throws a warning that i am unsure of how to correct, in total there are 20 but it is because if used the same line 20 times
                    apart from these warnigns all other pages pass with no errors or warnings!</p>
                    <p>Note: if you are using AdBlock, the google maps on the Homepage will show some erros when you go into Google Developer Tools</p>
